/**
 * Phase 11 design tokens — the JS-side counterpart to the Tailwind config
 * extension in tailwind.config.js. Tailwind classes can't be read by chart
 * libraries (Recharts needs real hex/rgba strings for fills, strokes,
 * gradients), so anything a chart or inline style needs lives here, kept
 * in sync with tailwind.config.js by hand (no build-time codegen — this
 * codebase has no existing token-sync tooling, and adding one would be a
 * disproportionate build-pipeline change for this phase).
 *
 * See DESIGN_SYSTEM.md for the full rationale.

 * Five tones, each with ONE fixed meaning — never mixed or substituted:
 *   - critical      — genuinely urgent/actionable risk. Used sparingly.
 *   - caution       — moderate/watch-list. Used sparingly, never as a
 *                      fallback/default for "don't know what else to use."

 *                      present regardless of findings (constant, not
 *                      risk-dependent) — must read as quiet, not alarming.
